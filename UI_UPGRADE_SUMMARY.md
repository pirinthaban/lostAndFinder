# 🎨 FindBack UI/UX Upgrade

## ✨ Visual Improvements

We have upgraded the entire application with a modern, cohesive design language.

### 1. Modern Color Palette
- **Primary**: Indigo 600 (`#4F46E5`) - Professional, trustworthy blue-purple.
- **Secondary**: Vibrant Orange (`#FFFF6B35`) - High contrast for actions and "Lost" items.
- **Accent**: Emerald 500 (`#10B981`) - Fresh green for "Found" items and success states.
- **Background**: Cool Gray 50 (`#F8F9FA`) - Clean, modern background.
- **Surface**: Pure White (`#FFFFFF`) - Crisp cards and dialogs.

### 2. Refined Shapes & Typography
- **Rounded Corners**: Increased from 12px to **16px** for a softer, friendlier feel.
